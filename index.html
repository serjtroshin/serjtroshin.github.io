  <h2><i class="fa fa-bookmark"></i> About me</h2>
  <p>I am the fist year PhD student at the <a href="https://ltl.science.uva.nl/">Language Technology Lab</a> at the University of Amsterdam supervised by <a href="https://vene.ro/">Vlad Niculae</a>. My research is mainly focused on probabilistic models and constrained generation for text. More broadly, I am interested in learning natural language processing and deep learning for source code.</p>
